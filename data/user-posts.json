    "content": "Imagine a hypothetical  machine with billions of knobs that  needs to be adjusted to operate  in the most possible effective ,and efficient way .  Now the problem is how to get knobs right so that it would be configured in optimized way  , one obvious way would be to do brute force  approach to search all possible combinations to  fine tune.\n\nIn the context of solving  optimization problems , one way would be to find the minimum possible way to  reach the most efficient possible outcome.\n",
